#Type Timer
Timer objects are used for calculating elapsed time. The functions `datetime.timer()` and <s>`timer.new()`</s> (deprecated) can be used to create `Timer` instances.

Timer objects have the following methods:

`poll()`

Returns the time, as an integer number of microseconds, since the timer was instantiated or last reset

`reset()`

Resets the timer
